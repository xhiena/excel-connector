## Insert Menu ##

To communicate with the Sforce API and insert records into salesforce.com, the data to represent a table must be arranged within an Excel Worksheet just as it is described the Query menu section

To insert a new row of data into salesforce.com

Enter the new data for these records into the appropriate columns, in the example in Figure 1 I have added a new account name, billing city and zip code

To inform the connector that you would like to insert this row of data into salesforce.com, place the keyword new into the account ID column, also shown in Figure 1.

To indicate the rows of data to be inserted, select (click on) one or more cells on the row which you would like to insert, the connector uses the currently selected row or rows to construct the insert Sforce function call. You may select multiple rows to be inserted.

With the data in place, and the keyword new in the account ID column, you're ready to insert the row, click on the connector menu item Insert Selected Rows.

The API insert function call returns the account ID, which is place back in to the worksheet, in this example Cell A8 is overwritten with the new account ID.

You may select and insert multiple rows, however there is a reasonable limit to the number of rows which may be inserted at one time. This limit may be disabled using the options dialog box.

The connector performs the Insert Rows function in a batch, however one or more rows may fail to insert into the database due to the contents of that row or the permisions of the object which it will be related to. In the case that a row is not inserted a message box will pop up at the end of the insert batch operation and the rows which failed will have a cell comment specifing the error message generated by the Force.com API. <br />
_NOTE: This implies that user cell comments may be deleted or overwritten in the insert process._
