With the target cells selected you are ready to run the connector menu item Update Selected Cells. The update function passes only the rows and columns which you have selected to the API in the form of an update call.

As the update call proceeds the cells which are being updated are briefly colored light yellow, this is an indication of the region that the connector is addressing.

Any error messages generated by the update call are presented to the user and simple message dialog box


## Limits ##

You may select as many cells as you like to update at one time within a reasonable limit, if you desire to update more than the reasonable limit you may adjust this setting using the options dialog box ( default update limit ~ 3500 rows)
