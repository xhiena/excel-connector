## Delete Objects Menu ##

To communicate with the Sforce API and delete records from salesforce.com, the data to represent a table must be arranged within an Excel Worksheet just as it is described the Query menu section

To delete one or more records from salesforce.com, select the rows you would like to delete and click the menu item **Delete Objects**.

You may select and delete multiple rows, each object which is deleted is placed in the recycle bin of the salesforce.com application. There is no way to restore deleted items using the API, so exercise caution when deleting multiple records
